### Explanation of Key Causes

- **Core Planning Issues**: Lack of a clear project scope, ambiguous requirements, and frequent scope creep are top causes of failure, as they prevent the team from aligning on a shared vision and result in missed deadlines.

- **Code Quality and Technical Debt**: Rapid development often accumulates technical debt and overlooks essential testing. This impacts long-term maintainability, leading to frequent bug fixes and slower development as the codebase becomes more complex.

- **Process and Communication Failures**: Ineffective communication, poor version control, and delayed feedback cycles can fragment team efforts and lead to redundant or conflicting work. Clear documentation, CI/CD consistency, and version control are essential to keep the workflow smooth.

- **Dependency Management**: Reliance on external APIs or services can delay progress, especially if integrations are buggy or fail due to external issues. Prioritizing dependencies and having fallback strategies helps mitigate delays.

- **Skill Gaps and DevOps Practices**: Insufficient skill diversity in the team can delay specific tasks. Inadequate DevOps practices, including lack of automated testing and CI/CD, lead to bottlenecks in deployment, impacting speed and quality.

Identifying and proactively addressing these issues ensures a smoother, more productive rapid development cycle, helping deliver high-quality MVPs within tight deadlines. Let me know if you need strategies for mitigating any specific issue!
